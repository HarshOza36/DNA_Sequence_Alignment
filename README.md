# DNA_Sequence_Alignment
This project was part of CSCI-570 - Analysis of Algorithms at The University of Southern California.

In this project we implement two sequence alignment algorithms.
- ```basic3.py``` is pure dynamic programming approach.
- ```efficient3.py``` is memory efficient approach which combines Divide and conquer and dynamic programming.
